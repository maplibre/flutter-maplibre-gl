> ``⚠️`` Current notice: the repository has been transferred to the @maplibre organization. You shouldn't see any negative effects, as GitHub automatically redirects references from the old URL to the new URL. Please see [#221](https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/issues/221) for more information.

This Flutter plugin allows to show **embedded interactive and customizable vector maps** as a Flutter widget. 

For the Android and iOS integration, we use [maplibre-gl-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native). For web, we rely on [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js). This project only supports a subset of the API exposed by these libraries. 


This project is a fork of [https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl), replacing its usage of Mapbox GL libraries with the open source [Maplibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre) libraries.

**Please note that this project is community driven and is not affiliated with the company Mapbox.** <br>
It does use some of their amazing open source libraries/tools, though. Thank you, Mapbox, for all the open-source work you do!


## Using the plugin in your project

This project is not yet available on pub.dev.
You can use it by referencing it in your `pubspec.yaml` like this:
```yaml
dependencies:
    ...
    maplibre_gl:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl.git
        ref: main
```
This will get you the very latest changes from the main branch.
You can replace `main` with the name of the [latest release](https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/releases)
to get a more stable version.



Compared to flutter-mapbox-gl, the only breaking API changes are: 
- `MapboxMap` <--> `MaplibreMap`
- `MapboxMapController` <--> `MaplibreMapController`


### Documentation
Documentation is available on the docs branch in the doc/api folder and automatically updated on each push to the main branch. You can easily preview the [documentation / API reference here.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/blob/docs/doc/api/index.html)

Please visit [https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) and [https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) for more information about the Maplibre libraries.

### iOS
To use this plugin with iOS, you **do not** need to adapt your app's Podfile anymore! If you previously adapted the Podfile because of the instructions here, this should not be necessary anymore with the latest changes and you should actually remove these lines from your Podfile to avoid build errors: 
<details>
<summary>View obsolete code</summary>

```ruby
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
source 'https://github.com/m0nac0/flutter-maplibre-podspecs.git'

pod 'MapLibre'
pod 'MapLibreAnnotationExtension'
```
</details>
You can also check our example app's Podfile: https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/blob/main/example/ios/Podfile

### Web
Include the following JavaScript and CSS files in the `<head>` of the `web/index.html` file.

```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@latest/dist/maplibre-gl.js'></script>

## Map Styles

Map styles can be supplied by setting the `styleString` in the `MaplibreMap` constructor. The following formats are supported:

1. Passing the URL of the map style. This should be a custom map style served remotely using a URL that start with 'http(s)://'
2. Passing the style as a local asset. Create a JSON file in the `assets` and add a reference in `pubspec.yml`. Set the style string to the relative path for this asset in order to load it into the map.
3. Passing the style as a local file. create an JSON file in app directory (e.g. ApplicationDocumentsDirectory). Set the style string to the absolute path of this JSON file.
4. Passing the raw JSON of the map style. This is only supported on Android.  

### Tile sources requiring an API key
If your tile source requires an API key, we recommend directly specifying a source url with the API key included.
For example:

 `https://tiles.example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.vector.pbf?api_key={your_key}`



## Location features
### Android
Add the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` to enable location features in an **Android** application:
```
<manifest ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

Starting from Android API level 23 you also need to request it at runtime. This plugin does not handle this for you. The example app uses the flutter ['location' plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/location) for this.

### iOS
To enable location features in an **iOS** application:

If you access your users' location, you should also add the following key to `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to explain why you need access to their location data:

```
xml ...
    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>[Your explanation here]</string>
```

A possible explanation could be: "Shows your location on the map".

## Running in GitHub Codespaces
When you open this project in GitHub Codespaces, you can run the example app on web with the command 
```
$ cd example
$ flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0
```

Codespaces should automatically take care of the necessary port forwarding, so that you can view the running web app on your local device or in a new tab.

**Please note:** the Docker image used to setup the Codespace is from CirrusCI and sets the Git username and email to CirrusCI default values. You should set these correctly, 
if you plan on committing from the Codespace.


## Fixing common issues
### Avoid Android UnsatisfiedLinkError

Update buildTypes in `android\app\build.gradle`

```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        // other configs
        ndk {
            abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a','x86_64', 'x86'
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS app crashes when using location based features

Please include the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` as described [here](#location-features)

### Layer is not displayed on IOS, but no error

Have a look in your `LayerProperties` object, if you supply a `lineColor` argument, (or any color argument) the issue might come from here.
Android supports the following format : `'rgba(192, 192, 255, 1.0)'`,  but on iOS, this doesn't work! 

You have to have the color in the following format : `#C0C0FF` 

### iOS crashes with error: `'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Invalid filter value: filter property must be a string'`
Check if one of your expression is : `["!has", "value"]`. Android support this format, but iOS does not.
You can replace your expression with :   `["!",["has", "value"] ]` which works both in Android and iOS.

Note : iOS will display the error : `NSPredicate: Use of 'mgl_does:have:' as an NSExpression function is forbidden`, but it seems like the expression still works well.
