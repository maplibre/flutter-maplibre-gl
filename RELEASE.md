## Release

Current process: for each release we also create a separate branch (`release-x.y.z`), tag (`x.y.z`) and Github release (`x.y.z`).

This document describes the steps needed to make a release:

For each supported library:
 - `maplibre_gl_platform_interface`
 - `maplibre_gl_web`
 - `flutter-maplibre-gl`

Perform the following actions (these changes should also be on `main`):
 - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the commits associated since previous release.
 - Update library version in `pubspec.yaml`


**Only on the release branch:** Repeat this action for `flutter-maplibre-gl` and `maplibre_gl_web` for the dependency_overrides:

```
Comment out:
dependency_overrides:
  mapbox_gl_platform_interface:
    path: ../mapbox_gl_platform_interface
```
Finally, create a Github release and git tag from the release branch.

The only difference between the release branch and `main` directly after the release are the `dependency_overrides` (these are useful for development and should therefore only be removed in the release branches)
