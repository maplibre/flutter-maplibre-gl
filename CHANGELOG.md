## 0.18.0
### Breaking Change:
Already since 0.17.0, developers do not need to adapt their Podfile for iOS apps anymore as it was previously described in the Readme. Developers who previously added these lines should remove them, since not removing these lines may cause a build failure on iOS. (This change actually already landed in 0.17.0, but it may not have been sufficiently clear that not removing these lines might break builds).

### Other Changes:

* new feature: set arbitrary layer properties by @m0nac0 in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/303
* Update release process by @m0nac0 in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/315
* Add workflows for automated publishing to pub.dev by @m0nac0 in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/328
* Fix example app pubspec by @m0nac0 in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/329
* Updated location plugin version for example app by @varunlohade in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/334
* Housekeeping: Improve docs and update outdated references to point to MapLibre by @m0nac0 in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/330


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/compare/0.17.0...0.18.0


## 0.17.0

**Repository transfer**: The project repository was transferred to the MapLibre GitHub organization. More information at  https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/issues/221

* Developers do not need to adapt their Podfile for iOS apps anymore as it was previously described in the Readme.  [https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/278](https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/278)
### Breaking Change:
* `maplibre_gl/mapbox_gl.dart` was renamed to `maplibre_gl/maplibre_gl.dart`. You can do a replace-all from `import 'package:maplibre_gl/mapbox_gl.dart';` to `import 'package:maplibre_gl/maplibre_gl.dart';`
* `useDelayedDisposal` was removed since its now fixed in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/259
* `useHybridCompositionOverride` was removed since it was added in the following fix: https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/203 and we reverted the fix and used another approach to fix the actual issue.
* The default for `myLocationRenderMode` was changed from `COMPASS` to `NORMAL` in https://github.com/maplibre/flutter-maplibre-gl/pull/244, since the previous default value of `COMPASS` implicitly enables displaying the location on iOS, which could crash apps that didn't want to display the device location. If you want to continue to use `MyLocationRenderMode.COMPASS`, please explicitly specify it in the constructor like this:
```dart
MaplibreMap(
 myLocationRenderMode: MyLocationRenderMode.COMPASS,
 ...
)
```
* The old api `registerWith` was removed from the MapboxMapsPlugin.java, since there is no need for that. 
* The `minSdkVersion` was bumped to at least 21 now, since the native android sdk constraint expect that. 
* Changed the minimum Dart version from sdk: `2.12.0` to `2.14.0` in `maplibre_gl_platform_interface/pubspec.yaml`.
