## 0.23.0

Example app updates aligned with the 0.23.0 plugin release.

### Added
* Demonstrations for runtime style switching & multiple style sources (`multi_style_switch.dart`, `layer_manipulation.dart`).
* Hover interaction showcase when running on desktop/web (uses `onFeatureHover`).

### Fixed
* Offline region download crash resolved (#569).
* Additional safety checks ensuring style fully loads before access (#563).

### Changed
* Updated dependencies (Android/iOS native, Flutter compatibility) in sync with core package.

### Notes
The example is not published; version number tracks major showcase changes, not a package release.
